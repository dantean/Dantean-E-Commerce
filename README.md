# E-Commerce backend

## What is it?

A backend database utilizing MySQL2 and Sequelize to function as a product management system for an e-commerce style website. 

## How To Use

* Clone the repo
* Type `npm i` in the console to install all required packages
* Type `mysql -u root -p` to start MySQL. Enter the `password` when prompted for a password (super duper secure!!!!)
* Type `source db/schema.sql` into the console to source the database using the provided schema
* Type `quit` to exit MySQL
* Type `npm run seed` to seed the database
* Type `npm start` to start the server
* The POST/PUT/GET/DELETE routes can all be tested in Insomnia using the paths following the template: `http://localhost:3001/api/`
